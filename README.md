# cpp
Teaching myself C++ in an effort to get closer to the metal. 


As the subject says, I'm teaching myself C++ to step down a level from some of the other languages 
that I know/am learning.  The education system, in my experience, doesnt seem to want to teach this 
kind of stuff anymore. 

A lot of the "basics" section will be review for me, but it cant hurt to go over it, especially if I catch something new.
